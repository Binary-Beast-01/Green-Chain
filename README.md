## Problem Addressed
In the current system problem is about establishing a digital thread between Boeingâ€™s systems to provide a unified view of the total CO2 emissions generated from their operations, specifically factories. This information can assist management in developing strategies to control CO2 emissions and obtain carbon credits from the government.

## Solution Addressed
Our innovative idea for addressing the challenge of tracking and managing carbon emissions and receiving automatic payments from the government is to use blockchain technology. By creating a blockchain-based system, data related to CO2 emissions can be securely stored and shared between different parties, ensuring transparency and standardization.
